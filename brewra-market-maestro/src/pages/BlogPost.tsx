      title: "Why Cultural Intelligence is the Missing Link in Global Sales",

      content: `Let's be honest—selling across borders isn't just about time zones and translations. It's about people. And people come with their context, unspoken rules, and expectations. That's where cultural intelligence (CQ) comes in - and it might just be the unfair advantage you've been overlooking.

## So what exactly is Cultural Intelligence?

Think of it as emotional intelligence's global cousin. CQ is your ability to relate to and work effectively with people from different cultural backgrounds. In global sales, that's not a nice-to-have; it's mission-critical.

Because here's the truth: even the most bulletproof sales script will fall flat if it clashes with local values, business etiquette, or communication styles.

Let's talk real-world. Imagine you're working on a global deal. In one country, a strong ROI pitch up front might signal confidence. In another, that same move could feel rushed or even impersonal.

And that's where many teams fall short.

Now picture this: you take a beat to understand the local business culture, lead with connection, and adapt your communication style. Suddenly, you're not just pitching - you're building trust.

Without cultural intelligence, your go-to-market efforts risk being technically correct but emotionally tone-deaf. You might be hitting all the right KPIs - but missing the emotional triggers that drive buying behavior in different regions.

## Why CQ beats a one-size-fits-all playbook

In Germany, clarity and precision win. In Brazil, personal relationships drive trust.

In the U.S., speed signals professionalism. In India, patience builds credibility.

In the UK, being too direct might be seen as rude. In Israel, it might be appreciated as honesty.

Sales success isn't about choosing who's right. It's about flexing to fit. CQ lets you read the room—even when that room is halfway across the world.

So why aren't more sales teams talking about this? Because cultural nuance doesn't show up on dashboards. Because you can't A/B test empathy. Because revenue leaders often confuse process with connection.

Without cultural intelligence, even the most well-intentioned sales outreach or marketing campaign can fall flat - or worse, offend.

## Some common pitfalls include:

- Using aggressive sales tactics in markets that value subtlety and consensus
- Relying on humor or idioms that don't translate well
- Misunderstanding hierarchy and who the actual decision-maker is
- Overlooking local buying rituals or business etiquette

These missteps cost deals. They also erode trust and credibility, which takes far longer to rebuild in international markets.

## Why CQ is a competitive advantage in Global Sales

You can't automate cultural intelligence. But you can build it. When your team embraces cultural intelligence, you don't just "localize" - you humanize. It starts with listening. With curiosity. With a willingness to learn—not just about your buyer, but from them. That's when the magic happens.

When you pair cultural intelligence with a rock-solid GTM strategy, you don't just open doors—you build lasting relationships that drive revenue.

At Brewra, we've seen this firsthand.

By combining Agentic AI with feet-on-the-street experience, we help GTM teams operate with cultural awareness baked in. Our 24/7 agents continuously scan signals, buyer behavior, and market nuances - so your outreach isn't just fast, but relevant.

If your global sales strategy is hitting invisible walls, it's likely not a product or pricing issue. It may be a culture gap.

The good news? Cultural intelligence can be learned, embedded, and scaled. When it is, you'll stop pitching to strangers and start building partnerships with people.

**Time to sell smarter. Globally.**`

      content: `So, you've got a great product or service, and you're ready to take over the world. But how do you get it out there and make it a success? That's where a go-to-market (GTM) strategy comes in. It's basically your roadmap for launching your product and reaching your target audience. A go-to-market (GTM) strategy outlines how a company will introduce its product or service to the market and achieve its business objectives. This strategy is crucial for ensuring that a product or service reaches its target audience and achieves the desired market penetration.

The best GTM strategy for a company will depend on various factors, including the product or service, target market, competition, and available resources. It is important to carefully consider these factors when developing a GTM strategy to ensure that it is effective and aligns with the company's overall business goals. To get started with it, there are multiple strategies you can adopt for your business. Let's discuss them in detail.

## Inbound and Outbound Strategy:

Think of an inbound GTM as a fishing rod. Instead of casting a wide net and hoping for a bite, you're creating a cosy spot on the riverbank with tasty treats. Fish (or customers) naturally come to you because they want what you've got. Similarly, Inbound GTM represents a customer-centric approach to attracting, engaging, and converting potential customers. Content marketing, SEO, email marketing, etc. are some of the key components. Inbound marketing can be more cost-effective than traditional marketing methods, as it focuses on creating organic content and building relationships rather than paid advertising.

Outbound strategy relies heavily on direct sales efforts to generate leads and close deals. It involves proactively reaching out to potential customers through various channels, such as cold calling, email outreach, and attending industry events. The primary goal is to convert leads into paying customers. The sales team plays a central role in driving revenue growth, and they tailor their messaging and offerings to individual prospects. Sales-Led GTM is most effective for businesses that sell high-value products or services and have a well-defined target market.

## Product-led strategy

Product-led strategy, or product-led growth (PLG), revolves around the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition and retention. In this model, the product is designed to be so valuable and easy to use that customers naturally discover and adopt it without significant sales or marketing intervention.

Some common examples of PLG are Slack, Zoom, Hubspot, Dropbox, etc. Hubspot offers a free grader tool to attract potential customers. Slack populates empty spaces with in-app messages that drive action. Dropbox reduces customer acquisition costs through referral programs.

When customers love the product, they are more likely to remain loyal and use it more. It can also reduce the need for traditional sales and marketing efforts, as the product itself drives customer acquisition and retention. By encouraging customers to upgrade to premium features or purchase additional products, PLG can increase customer lifetime value.

## Channel-led strategy

Channel-led strategy involves leveraging third-party partners to distribute and sell a company's products or services. Rather than focusing on the product or marketing solely, it actually focuses on the sales partners and networks. These partners, known as channels, can include distributors, retailers, resellers, wholesalers, brokers, and agents. Some of the most common examples of CLG are Microsoft, Intel, etc.

Some of the key benefits of channel-led strategy are:

- **Expanded market reach:** Partners can help a company reach new customers and markets that it might not be able to access on its own.
- **Increased sales:** Partners can provide valuable sales expertise and resources, helping to drive sales and revenue growth.
- **Reduced costs:** Partnering with channels can help reduce the costs associated with sales, marketing, and customer support.
- **Shared risk:** By sharing the risk of market entry and customer acquisition with partners, companies can mitigate their exposure to potential losses.

By leveraging a channel-led growth strategy, businesses can expand their market reach, increase sales, and reduce costs. However, it is important to carefully select and manage partners to ensure that they are aligned with the company's goals and provide value to customers.

## Which strategy to use?

Now that we have discussed in detail the GTM strategies companies can adopt, the common question arrives: Which strategy to use?

Well, it's important to note that GTM strategies are not static. It's okay to mix and match these strategies and to tweak your approach as things change. The most important thing is to keep experimenting and finding what works best for your business. If you want to have a better understanding, you can check out Brewra's Market Development.

Businesses may need to adapt their approach over time to respond to changing market conditions, customer preferences, and competitive pressures. So, there you have it—a bunch of different ways businesses can get their products or services out there. Whether you're going all-in on social media or building a massive sales team, the key is to pick a strategy that fits your product, your customers, and your goals for your business.`

      title: "Top Recurring GTM Mistakes SaaS Founders Should Avoid",

      content: `The SaaS industry is booming in the current times, and we see B2B SaaS companies rely a lot on GTM strategies to launch and expand their businesses. A well-executed GTM strategy can help you crack the markets well, optimise their resources, minimise risks, and achieve sustainable growth. A Go-to-market (GTM) strategy encompasses various aspects, including market research, product positioning, sales and marketing efforts, pricing, and customer acquisition and retention.

Not all SaaS companies succeed in the market; many fail despite having an excellent product or service. SaaS founders make common GTM mistakes that can hinder their growth and profitability of their business. These errors often stem from a lack of experience, insufficient market research, or a failure to adapt to changing market dynamics.

## 1. Lack of Target Market Definition

One of the most fundamental mistakes B2B SaaS founders make is failing to clearly define their target market. Companies may spend time and money pursuing leads that are unlikely to convert. Without a deep understanding of their ideal customer profile (ICP), it's impossible to create a GTM strategy that resonates with potential customers.

## 2. Rushing to hire members

While it's important to build a strong team to support growth, hiring too quickly without careful consideration can lead to multiple challenges for a startup. Hiring prematurely can lead to unnecessary overhead expenses, especially if the new hires are not fully utilised or don't contribute significantly to revenue. A lot of times founders hire a senior VP of sales or marketing for their operations, which can be either a best or worst decision for business. If the hire cannot create demand generation for you, the whole process becomes a waste. You need someone who can commit numbers and get it delivered for you by the end of the day.

## 3. Rushing to Market

Many founders are eager to launch their product as soon as possible, but rushing to market without proper testing and validation can lead to significant problems. Improper market research and not understanding the need for your service in this competitive market can be really disastrous.

## 4. Ignoring Customer Feedback

Another common mistake is neglecting to gather and act on customer feedback. By listening to what your customers have to say, you can identify areas for improvement, refine your product, and tailor your messaging to their needs.

## 5. Over-relying on a Single Channel

Diversifying your marketing efforts is crucial for reaching a wider audience and mitigating risks. Relying too heavily on a single acquisition channel can make your business vulnerable to changes in the market or platform. Different channels can offer unique opportunities for lead generation, customer engagement, and brand building. It will provide a more comprehensive view of customer behaviour and preferences.

## 6. Neglecting content marketing and misaligned messages

In today's digital age, content marketing is essential for attracting and engaging potential customers. By creating valuable and informative content, you can establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry and build trust with your target audience. Your messaging should be clear and aligned. Inconsistent or unclear messaging can confuse potential customers and hinder your ability to convert leads into sales.

## 7. Underestimating Sales Enablement

Arming your sales team with the necessary tools, training, and resources is essential for closing deals effectively. Mostly what companies lack is the coordination between the sales team and marketing, which can lead to low productivity, missed opportunities, and a negative customer experience.

## 8. Incorrect Pricing Strategy

Setting the right price for your SaaS product is crucial for profitability. If your pricing is too high, you may struggle to attract customers. If it's too low, you may not be able to cover your costs and generate sufficient revenue. Compare your price with your competitors to understand better where you stand in the market. The founders often make the mistake of not keeping the pricing flexible. Always keep your USP in mind and experiment with it.

## 9. Failing to measure and analyse

To make data-driven decisions and optimise your GTM strategy, it's essential to track key metrics and analyse your performance. Without proper measurement, you may be wasting resources on ineffective tactics. Never let your data go to waste; instead, regularly review your metrics and identify trends and patterns.

If you read and understand the above points, these factors play a major contributing factor to a startup's downfall. By avoiding these common mistakes and implementing a well-thought-out GTM strategy, founders can increase their chances of success and achieve sustainable growth in the competitive B2B SaaS landscape.`

      content: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undeniably revolutionized various industries, and sales is no exception. AI is reshaping the sales landscape from lead generation and customer segmentation to predictive analytics and sales forecasting. However, amidst AI hype, one fundamental question persists: Can AI genuinely replace the human touch in sales?

## The Rise of AI in Sales Execution

AI has become an invaluable tool for sales teams worldwide. It excels at:

**Data Analysis:** AI can process vast amounts of data to identify patterns, trends, and customer insights, enabling sales teams to make informed decisions.

**Automation:** Routine tasks like data entry, email scheduling, and appointment setting can be automated, freeing up sales reps to focus on building relationships.

**Personalization:** AI can analyze customer behavior and preferences to deliver highly personalized messages and offers.

**Predictive Analytics:** By analyzing historical data, AI can predict customer behavior and sales outcomes, helping sales teams prioritize leads and allocate resources effectively.

While AI has undoubtedly made significant strides in automating various sales processes, it's essential to recognize its limitations. AI algorithms are trained on historical data, and they struggle to adapt to unforeseen circumstances or rapidly changing market conditions. Additionally, AI lacks the emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills necessary for building strong customer relationships.

## The Indispensable Human Element

The human touch remains irreplaceable in sales. Here's why:

**Building Relationships:** Trust and rapport are the cornerstones of successful sales. These can only be cultivated through genuine human interaction. Salespeople can empathize with customers' needs, understand their pain, and build lasting trust-based relationships.

**Empathy and Understanding:** Sales is about connecting with people and solving their problems. Empathy is crucial for understanding customers' perspectives and tailoring solutions to their needs. Humans possess the innate ability to read between the lines, pick up on subtle cues, and adapt their approach accordingly.

**Negotiation and Persuasion:** Complex sales deals often require skilled negotiation and persuasion. Humans excel at building rapport, understanding the other party's motivations, and finding mutually beneficial solutions. AI-driven systems, while capable of analyzing data patterns, need more flexibility and creativity for effective negotiation.

**Problem Solving:** Sales involves overcoming challenges and objections. Humans can think critically, adapt to changing situations, and solve problems creatively. They can also leverage their experience and intuition to navigate complex sales cycles.

## The Future of Sales: A Hybrid Approach

The most effective sales strategy is a blend of human expertise and AI capabilities. AI can serve as a powerful tool to augment human abilities, providing data-driven insights and automating routine tasks. Salespeople, equipped with this information, can focus on building relationships, delivering exceptional customer experiences, and closing deals.

For example, AI can analyze customer data to identify potential leads, while salespeople can leverage this information to personalize their outreach and build rapport. AI can also provide real-time insights during sales calls, enabling salespeople to address customer concerns effectively.

## Case Study: A Global Tech Company

A leading global tech company was struggling to increase its sales efficiency and improve customer satisfaction. They implemented an AI-powered sales platform to analyze customer data, identify sales opportunities, and automate routine tasks. The AI system provided salespeople with valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, enabling them to tailor their approach accordingly.

As a result, the company experienced a significant increase in sales, improved win rates, and higher customer satisfaction. The AI system helped salespeople become more efficient and effective, allowing them to focus on building stronger relationships with customers.

In conclusion, while AI has undoubtedly transformed the sales landscape, it's essential to recognize that it's a complement, not a replacement, for human interaction. The future of sales lies in a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI, where technology empowers salespeople to achieve greater success. By combining the strengths of AI and human expertise, sales organizations can achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.`

      title: "How to find your Total Addressable Market ( TAM)",

      content: `Startups often face unique challenges in their early stages of growth. Limited resources, intense competition, and uncertainty in the market can make it difficult to gain traction and scale rapidly. However, with the right strategies and execution, startups can overcome these hurdles and achieve significant growth. One such important metric businesses can implement is finding Total Addressable Market (TAM).

Understanding your Total Addressable Market (TAM) is crucial for B2B SaaS companies. Total Addressable Market (TAM) can be defined as the maximum potential revenue a company can generate by selling a product or service to its entire target market. In simple words, it's the most possible revenue a product/ service can generate. TAM is calculated simply by understanding the total market size with the estimated market share for your business. (TAM = Total market size * Your estimated market share.)

When calculating TAM for B2B SaaS companies, several key factors must be considered. These include the overall size of the market, the specific segment of the market the company targets, the percentage of that market already using similar products, the average price of the SaaS product, the cost of acquiring new customers, and the total revenue each customer generates over their lifetime. By understanding these factors, businesses can more accurately assess their potential market and make informed strategic decisions.

Let's say we have a B2B SaaS product specially for Fintech companies, so we need to: 

**Identify the total market size:** Based on industry reports and forecasts, the company estimates that the global fintech market is expected to reach $15 billion by 2025.

**Estimate market share:** Considering the company believes its target market is 3% of the global fintech market with its product.

**Calculate TAM:** $15 billion * 3% = $450 million.

Therefore, the TAM for the fintech SaaS product would be $450 million.

While the importance of the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is clear, accurately calculating it can be a complex task due to the challenge of finding reliable and up-to-date data. To streamline this process, businesses can leverage external tools like Statista, IBISWorld, G2 Crowd, and Nielsen. These platforms provide valuable industry information, market data, and consumer insights, enabling automated TAM calculations and freeing up time for strategic planning and execution.

TAM, or Total Addressable Market actually helps businesses to communicate their market potential to key stakeholders. It demonstrates the scale of the opportunity,and informs decision-making. By understanding the TAM, businesses can attract investors, optimize resource allocation, and develop effective marketing and sales strategies to drive growth and maximize value.

Calculating TAM isn't just about finding an accurate figure; it's also about considering the competitive landscape. While TAM is essential, it's not without challenges. The market is dynamic, influenced by technological advancements, shifting customer needs, and competitive pressures. Companies often face challenges in estimating market size and penetration due to data limitations and varying information. Additionally, factors like new product launches and changes in competitor strategies can significantly impact the market.

To conclude, the path to market success isn't linear, it's a dynamic process requiring continuous adaptation and refinement. By leveraging a combination of primary and secondary research, data-driven insights, and strategic analysis, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their total addressable market. This knowledge empowers them to tailor marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions that drive substantial growth. For startups, calculating TAM and understanding the market-sizing can not just be a part of the plan, it is the turning point in their business.`

      content: `Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy serves as the roadmap for a company's journey to successfully introduce and sell its products or services in the marketplace. It outlines the tactics, channels, and resources required to reach target customers and achieve revenue goals. A well-crafted GTM strategy is essential for startups and established businesses, providing a clear direction and maximizing the potential for growth and success.

## How are B2B SaaS Go-to-market Strategies Different From Standard Product Strategies?

SaaS GTM strategies differ significantly from traditional product or service marketing due to the unique nature of the SaaS business model. Unlike one-time sales, SaaS companies generate recurring revenue through subscription fees, emphasizing customer lifetime value and retention. Additionally, providing excellent customer support and success services is essential for retaining customers and fostering upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

As a start-up founder, let's consider that you have a product or service ready, but how will you market it and launch it? This is where you develop a detailed plan for your service to ensure a smooth process from start to finish. Understanding your customer well is the primary and the most crucial strategy any business needs to take care of. We shall know in detail how to identify our Ideal customer profile and acquire them.

The process involves creating detailed buyer personas, mapping customer journeys, and leveraging AI-powered data analysis. You may need to develop cohesive marketing campaigns, conduct in-depth GTM analysis, and streamline lead generation. Identify your customers with the help of these basic parameters:

- Geography
- Industry
- Employee Count
- Revenue
- Department and its size

To acquire your initial 100 customers, you'll need a robust outreach strategy. Tools like Apollo, Hubspot, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator can help you build a pipeline of potential customers. Once you've identified your target audience, reach out to them directly. To determine if you're contacting the right decision-maker, assess factors such as:

- Job title and role
- Demographics (seniority, education, technical degrees/certifications)
- Goals and objectives
- Challenges and pain points
- Preferred communication channels
- Decision-making process
- Objections and concerns

Understanding why anyone would buy your product or service is necessary. Is your product just another in the crowded market, or does it solve a problem? By identifying your Unique Selling Propositions (USPs), you can clearly articulate your product's distinct benefits to your clients. Also, create a content calendar featuring blogs, articles, webinars, and other resources to engage your target audience and increase organic traffic to your website.

Tailor your marketing strategies around the pain points of your ideal customer profile and how your solution addresses them. Craft compelling LinkedIn messages, cold emails, and cold calls for outreach on various platforms. Implement targeted campaigns to generate at least 50 marketing qualified leads (MQLs) per quarter. Monitor email open and response rates to track performance and gather valuable data. Some of the marketing-qualified leads you've contacted will now advance to the next stage as sales-qualified leads, indicating a higher likelihood of purchasing your product or service.

The sales team plays a vital role in achieving these goals. Equip yourself with all necessary tools and resources, such as CRM software, sales decks, and training materials required to drive the revenue. The team should efficiently handle the sales pipeline from initial outreach to prospecting to closing deals, including arranging demos, following up via email, conducting paid proofs of concept, drafting proposals, negotiating contracts, and managing renewals. Set KPIs and regularly monitor and analyze key metrics like customer acquisition cost and conversion rate to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategy in achieving desired outcomes.

## Real-World Examples of Successful GTM Strategies

Lets check out some examples of GTM strategies developed by now successful B2B SaaS companies. Slack's product-led GTM strategy focused on organic growth through a freemium model, word-of-mouth marketing, and integration-first approach. By prioritizing user experience and solving pain points in team communication, Slack enabled bottom-up adoption, targeting individual teams to drive organic growth within companies.

Pipedrive's GTM strategy focused on user-centric design, content marketing, paid advertising, and a robust partner program. By addressing specific pain points for salespeople and prioritizing ease of use, Pipedrive was able to achieve unicorn status in 2020 and grow its customer base to 100,000 by 2023.

## The Importance of a Structured GTM Approach

According to a recent study, companies with a well-structured Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy are 33% more likely to meet their revenue goals. This statistic explains why you need a solid GTM framework in place. An annual GTM strategy will always help you to understand where you stand in the current situation. Otherwise, challenges like inconsistent marketing and messages, improper or wrong resource allocation, increased cost and lower conversion rates, and missed sales opportunities may likely occur.

A successful B2B SaaS GTM strategy requires understanding your market, value proposition, and distribution channels. Following these guidelines helps you create a structured plan for your product's growth. In today's competitive B2B SaaS landscape, expert guidance is essential. Brewra Ventures offers flexible solutions for B2B SaaS businesses wanting global expansion. Strategic funding fuels your GTM strategy, supporting effective scaling. For long-term success, continuously evaluate and refine your strategy based on market dynamics and feedback.`

      content: `It's not easy to go into a foreign market with a value prop and acquire customers. Be it SaaS or ai. Different customer categories exist in a market within different concentric circles. So does your competition in that market. To break into a circle, it takes years of effort and support from the ecosystem. So how do you acquire customers in a foreign land…. ?

The easiest way to kick-start the engine is to fire up a few hyper personalized email campaigns. This is a very good way to test waters and vibrancy within the customer segment. You get a sense of who is your customer and what are the basic prerequisites of the product that you are trying to sell.

For instance, is language translation a must or will left to right alignments need to be made in the product. How much of the meta needs to change? Who are your reference-able customers in the region who will add that trust factor for new customers to explore further.

A big part of winning the first 3 to 5 customers requires transformation. What we term as masking, while winning the first 25 customers requires committing to the market. You commit to the market and the market yields a return for you.

Series of steps are involved in this journey. You must walk the talk, the language, the cultural factors, build relationships and generate substantial value for customers to take the risk with you. To take the plunge you must plug yourself in a network or enter a concentric circle & have someone local enough to help navigate the network. Remember – what you are trying to do is not just sell your product, but to build trust and relationships in the real world which brings wealth / value for your network in some way or the other.

A simple example could be a close door dinner party with family for some of your closest allies. This will surely get you to listen to how your prospects think about you and what they envision your product will deliver for them. Great way to earn trust via commitment and deliveries. One leads to another; such exercises will generate the reference targeted account list. Consider this as a list of enterprises that have a potential to become your customer. Now it's not an email campaign for low hanging fruits, it's an old-world relationship and good old sales. Go meet Jim, a friend of mine at Acme Inc.

      content: `In my earlier blog, named, "Acquiring 1 to 10 enterprise SaaS customers in a foreign land" – I wrote how to go about generating a targeted account list. You will be surprised that this kind of a list will be spot on with your ICP list. This is primarily since your own prospects have developed this list for you and not your sales research team. When your own customer or close prospect refers you to another prospect, it's always different.

Now, you have a POC in hand to initiate discussion or at FREE will to establish contact with someone in the targeted company. However, you move forward, discovering whether the problem resonates with them is a simple conversation. The moment they hear Jim referred you to them, you are within one of the concentric circles ready to share and discuss as much as possible. Very soon it all goes "we" from "me"!

A greater organization is pulled in quickly and generally an owner/buyer emerges from within the company who will champion your cause and take responsibility.

To be sure on whether he is championing the right cause – a simulation or pilot demand is put to commission. This is a 40% win for you. No company likes to invest effort and money unless they are sure they want to pursue the discussion. will write about these more during my next post… Till then, stay well.`

      content: `So, you want to expand your business and take over the world? Well, that's awesome, but it's more complicated than it sounds, especially when trying to enter new markets. That's where a GTM (Go-To-Market) Partner comes in. They're like your strategic and hands-on execution business partner who helps you navigate the local regulations, market dynamics, and consumer behaviors of new markets.

## What's a GTM Partner anyway?

A GTM or Go To Market partner is your business buddy who helps you expand into existing or new markets. They work with you to understand your business goals and objectives and develop a customized market penetration/entry plan. They'll help you optimize your sales and marketing strategies with hands-on execution and provide valuable insights into local consumer behavior.

## Why do you need a GTM Partner?

You need a GTM Partner if you want to scale your business globally, especially in markets like the USA, UK, MEA, APAC, and Scandinavian regions. These markets have unique consumer behaviors, regulations, language constraints, and cultural nuances, which can be a pain in the neck to navigate without local expertise.

A GTM Partner can help you with:

**Local market expertise:** They know the ins and outs of local markets, including consumer behavior, regulations, buyer mentality, and cultural differences. This means you can tailor your products or services to local consumer preferences and optimize your sales and marketing strategies much faster.

**Faster market entry:** Entering new markets can be time-consuming. Your GTM Partner can help you accelerate your market entry and capitalize on new business opportunities faster with their feet on the ground and existing business network.

**Reduced risk:** Entering new markets can be expensive and risky. A GTM Partner can help you mitigate these risks by providing valuable insights and local know-how on the existing market, customer segments, existing players, buyer sentiment, and other vital factors.

## How do you choose the right GTM Partner?

Choosing the right GTM Partner is essential for the success of your global expansion strategy. Here are some things to look for:

- **Local expertise:** Choose a partner who knows the local market like the back of their hand.
- **Industry-specific knowledge:** Look for a partner who knows your industry inside and out.
- **Proven track record:** Choose a partner with a track record of helping businesses to enter new markets and achieve their growth objectives.
- **Strong network:** Look for a partner with a solid local network, including contacts in government, industry associations, and other key stakeholders.

In conclusion, partnering with a GTM Partner is an intelligent move if you want to take your business to the next level. They'll help you navigate the challenges of penetrating existing or entering new markets and provide valuable insights that can help you optimize your sales and marketing strategies. Just remember to choose a partner with local expertise, industry-specific knowledge, a proven track record, and a strong network.`

At Brewra, we're not just another market development service. We're in the business of breaking records. Our approach is a blend of science and art, capturing the essence of a value proposition and resonating with the target user persona. We don't rely on A/B testing and multiple-theme messaging; we invest in empathy and emotional intelligence before tech stacks.

At Brewra, we have a track record of exceeding expectations daily. Our success lies in our ability to truly understand the value proposition and connect emotionally with our target user personas. We don't solely rely on A/B testing and generic messaging; empathy and emotional intelligence are at the forefront of our approach. With Brewra, you can trust that we prioritize human connection before turning to technology.

Take, for instance, Lead qualification. Most businesses will fire up LinkedIn sales navigators and zoom in with different constraints based on the ICP. This is the Stone Age; having basic measurements doesn't allow any system to discover my unique love of paintings or money plants. This is why our data enrichment and campaigns are all fine-tuned towards spending time & listening. With listening, we can understand and empathize emotionally and functionally.

Developing meaningful connections is priceless. It's all about establishing relationships instead of solely depending on CRM tactics. Take a look at this statistic from an outreach campaign.`

      content: `In this article, we are going to explain what we undergo doing during our Customer Discovery Service and why this is important for early-stage B2B SaaS startups, especially during the global expansion phase.

To start with, it is important to understand that what a SaaS company has achieved in their home turf in terms of their customers and revenue might not be relevant to similar customer persona in an alternate country. For instance; social economic conditions and work culture processes are very different for the Insurance industry across different countries even for one single brand. What MetLife India is buying, is not a priority for MetLife US!

It is supercritical to learn about the problems and challenges MetLife is facing and to present to them the problem/pain point that your SaaS solution addresses and learn whether it resonates well to further invest time, effort and money. You could be addressing a primary requirement or a secondary need and your goal is to map the insurance market and what people pay for. Customer Discovery sessions help SaaS providers to build strategy & achieve this.

Customer inputs and mindshare is absolutely critical when entering new markets. For e.g; SaaS providers are faced with the question of anchor customers. Not just from a pain problem standpoint, but also from reference, market commitment, support, business continuity and customer success standpoint. After all, a customer invests in a SaaS not just for their Value Proposition which includes LTV/Payback, but also looks at the SaaS provider as a partner for their own competitiveness and growth in the market. How can MetLife get an edge over liberty by consuming your SaaS?

So, how do you validate whether your product will sell in the US market or GCC or SEA in your target customer segment ? You co-create a journey with your customers and onboard anchor customers using your Customer Discovery technique.

For matured SaaS providers with mid to large market success, we bundle Customer Discovery and Market Development together helping them to activate and acquire both (new anchor customers and sell in the market) all at the same time during our initial weeks.

      content: `Expanding your B2B SaaS business into new markets can be an expensive, thrilling, but intimidating journey, particularly when it comes to highly competitive markets such as the US or UK. However, with the right local GTM partner, you can tackle these challenges with confidence and expertise.

Here are a few ways Team Brewra can help you expand into these markets and achieve scalable, repeatable business growth:

## Conducting market research and customer discovery

Our team of experts can dive deep into the market and conduct customer research on your problem, enabling you to identify whether it's a painkiller or a vitamin, establish gaps in the market, and identify potential competitors. This allows you to tailor your product offering to meet your prospects' specific needs, ultimately differentiating your offering from competitors. Don't forget, the Market is mainly fixed – it's the product that's variable.

## Understanding local culture, norms, and messaging with our local Director

We understand the importance of adapting your product and marketing to the local audience, and we can help you understand the local culture, norms, and language differences. Our Sales Director, US or UK, is dedicated to creating strong messaging that resonates with the local audience and drives engagement with your product offering.

## Market Development

It is evident that you have achieved local success in your home territory and want to expand your offering to capture a bigger market, but here are two words of caution: The early stage 0 to 1 journey in your new territory is going to take twice the amount of time that it took for your home region and you will need to iterate a lot faster. As Team Brewra, we deep dive into your market, product, competitors, your sales and marketing stack, USP, and GTM, and start sales prospecting to segment the market & design funnel growth.

## Building local partnerships and networks

Building relationships with key players beyond just bank and travel lodging agencies in the market is essential for success. As your GTM partner, we can help you identify these players and build strong partnerships with them. This can help you establish credibility with potential customers and gain traction in the market.

## Achieving highly scalable and repeatable businesses

"Get out of the building" and get to know your customers in their own environment– as Steve Blank would say, is our motto and goal from day one. During our Customer Discovery Interview call sessions, we talk to potential prospects, asking them how they are solving the problem we are trying to address, how often the problem occurs, what is the intensity and workarounds to address the problem, etc. The learnings are priceless and often lead us to a few ideal customers and, more importantly, teach us a lot about customer segmentation / potential repeatable businesses in the market.

## Partnering with us for your success

Partnering with a GTM partner such as Team Brewra can help you shorten your Go-To-Market timeframe and bring that ready-to-go market expertise with you from day 1. By leveraging our expertise, resources, and industry connections, we can help you overcome challenges, capitalize on opportunities, and achieve scalable, repeatable growth.

Expanding into new markets is an exciting journey, but it can be challenging without the right expertise and resources. As your GTM partner, we are committed to helping you achieve your goals and expand your business in the US and/or UK market. Contact us today to learn how we can partner with you for your success.`

      author: "Sunny Ghosh",
      date: "June 21, 2024",

      image: "/lovable-uploads/786ec2d9-b9e6-432a-b2a3-388c1a8830fb.png",
      content: `Often we get this wrong. Getting to your first 10 customers is not equivalent to achieving product market fit. But, it's the right step towards your journey. Product market fit is not the only thing that matters in growing your business.

I am a big proponent of Brian Balfour's theory of product-market fit. In fact, a better way to put this together as Brian says is to address it as Market Product Fit, as the market doesn't change so often, and the product needs to fit into the market. Not the other way around.

## Market Product Fit Is Not Binary

The iteration cycle of market product fit brings us to another key point: Market Product Fit is not binary. It's also not a single point in time. A better way to think about Market Product Fit is on a spectrum of weak to strong.

As for the common PMF indicators, one needs to combine qualitative measurements with quantitative measurements and one's intuition; typically, if you have 1000 customers with 5000 to 6000 signups happening on a monthly basis, you could argue that you are well headed toward Market Product Fit.

## Qualitative Understanding with Net Promoter Score (NPS)

To get a qualitative understanding, my preference is to use Net Promoter Score (NPS). If you are truly solving the audience's problem, they should be willing to recommend your product to a friend. Here's an example of what an NPS form/graph looks like;

## Quantitative Measures: Retention Curves and Direct Traffic

There are two quantitative measures to understand Market Product Fit: Retention Curves and Direct Traffic. The second quantitative indicator is direct traffic. Direct traffic is typically the result of word of mouth. If you are truly solving an audience's problem, they tend to tell friends. It might not be a lot of direct traffic, but there should be some.

The two combined (flat retention curves and direct traffic) mean that a product with Market Product fit will grow naturally without additional efforts like paid marketing.

## The Third Indicator: LTV/CAC Ratio

There's a 3rd indicator, too; LTV/CAC ratio: 21 percent

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV/CAC Ratio)

The lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio — arguably the most revenue-driven framework — is a measure of how much you make from a customer relative to how much you spend to get one.

**(LTV) = Gross Margin % X Avg. Monthly Payment / Churn Rate**

**(CAC) = Sales and Marketing Costs / New Customers Won**

This might seem like a straightforward metric until you start to unpack marketing acquisition costs and define what it means to be an acquired customer.

The key is to understand that achieving product-market fit is not a destination but a continuous journey of understanding your market, iterating on your product, and measuring the right indicators to ensure you're moving in the right direction.`
